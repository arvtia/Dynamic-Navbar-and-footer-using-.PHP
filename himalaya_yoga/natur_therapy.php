            Nature has long been known to have calming effects on the mind. The beauty and serenity of nature create a sense of peace that you usually won’t be able to find in busy urban environments. Thus, spending time in nature is one of the most effective ways to reduce everyday stress and mental fatigue.

        Nature can generate a multitude of positive emotions, such as calmness, joy, creativity and can facilitate concentration. <strong> Nature connectedness is also associated with lower levels of poor mental health; in particular lower depression and anxiety levels.</strong>
